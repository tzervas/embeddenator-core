# Security Audit: embeddenator-retrieval

**Date:** January 4, 2026  
**Auditor:** Workflow Orchestrator  
**Scope:** embeddenator-retrieval component extraction (Issue #19)  
**Status:**  APPROVED - No unsafe code

---

## Executive Summary

Security audit completed for the embeddenator-retrieval component prior to extraction from the monorepo. **No unsafe code blocks identified** in any module.

**Modules Audited:**
- `src/retrieval.rs` (221 LOC)
- `src/resonator.rs` (357 LOC)

**Total:** 578 lines of code, all safe Rust.

---

## Audit Methodology

1. **Automated scanning** - grep search for `unsafe` keyword
2. **Manual code review** - Inspection of all public APIs and internal logic
3. **Dependency analysis** - Verification of safe dependencies

---

## Findings

### retrieval.rs -  SAFE

**Purpose:** Inverted index for sparse ternary vector search with reranking.

**Key components:**
- `TernaryInvertedIndex` - Postings list-based index
- `SearchResult` - Approximate dot-product scores
- `RerankedResult` - Exact cosine similarity scores
- `query_top_k()` - Candidate generation
- `rerank_candidates_by_cosine()` - Exact reranking

**Memory safety:**
- Uses safe Rust vectors and hash maps
- No pointer arithmetic or raw memory access
- Bounds checking on dimension access (`if d < DIM`)
- Safe indexing with touched flags to avoid out-of-bounds

**Dependencies:**
- `embeddenator_vsa::SparseVec` (audited in SECURITY_AUDIT_SIMD_COSINE.md)
- `std::collections::HashMap` (safe)

**Verdict:** No unsafe code, all operations use safe Rust primitives.

### resonator.rs -  SAFE

**Purpose:** Resonator networks for pattern completion and factorization.

**Key components:**
- `Resonator` - Iterative refinement engine
- `FactorizeResult` - Factorization results with convergence metrics
- `project()` - Nearest-neighbor projection to codebook
- `cleanup()` - Noise reduction through projection
- `factorize()` - Compound representation factorization

**Memory safety:**
- Uses safe Rust vectors for codebook storage
- Iterative algorithms with safe convergence checks
- No pointer manipulation or raw memory access
- All VSA operations delegated to safe embeddenator_vsa primitives

**Dependencies:**
- `embeddenator_vsa::SparseVec` (audited)
- `embeddenator_vsa::ReversibleVSAConfig` (audited)
- `serde` (safe serialization)

**Verdict:** No unsafe code, all operations use safe abstractions.

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk:**  **MINIMAL**

| Category | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Memory Safety | None | All safe Rust, no unsafe blocks |
| Buffer Overflows | None | Bounds checking in all array accesses |
| Uninitialized Memory | None | All allocations via safe constructors |
| Data Races | None | No interior mutability, uses &mut references |
| Integer Overflow | Low | Uses i32 for scores, saturating would be safer |

---

## Recommendations

### Non-Critical Improvements

1. **Consider saturating arithmetic** in retrieval.rs score accumulation:
   ```rust
   // Current:
   scores[id] += 1;
   
   // Safer:
   scores[id] = scores[id].saturating_add(1);
   ```
   Risk is minimal since sparse vectors have dimension limits.

2. **Convergence check** in resonator.rs is robust but could add max iteration safeguard:
   ```rust
   if iterations >= max_iterations {
       warn!("Resonator did not converge after {} iterations", iterations);
   }
   ```

These are **optional enhancements** and do not block extraction.

---

## Approval

**Status:**  **APPROVED FOR EXTRACTION**

Both modules are safe to extract into the embeddenator-retrieval component. No unsafe code blocks require documentation or special handling.

**Approval Date:** January 4, 2026  
**Next Step:** Proceed with component extraction workflow
