## Executive Summary

The Embeddenator project requires self-hosted GitHub Actions runners to support multi-architecture builds (ARM64, x86_64) and specialized hardware (GPU) that are not available in GitHub's standard hosted runner fleet. This document specifies the design, implementation, and operational requirements for a robust, automated self-hosted CI infrastructure.

### Key Objectives

1. **Multi-Architecture Support**: Native ARM64 builds without emulation overhead
2. **GPU Acceleration**: Support for GPU-accelerated workloads in future development
3. **Cost Optimization**: Auto-scaling runners with idle timeout management
4. **Automation**: Fully automated runner lifecycle management
5. **Reliability**: High availability with automatic recovery and health monitoring

### Success Criteria

-  ARM64 CI workflow completes successfully on self-hosted runners
-  Runner automation system manages lifecycle without manual intervention
-  Cost savings >50% compared to cloud-based alternatives
-  Build time <15 minutes for full test suite on ARM64
-  Zero manual runner management required during normal operation

---

## Project Overview

### Background

Embeddenator is a Rust-based holographic computing substrate that requires testing and building on multiple architectures:

- **AMD64 (x86_64)**: Primary architecture, fully supported by GitHub-hosted runners
- **ARM64 (aarch64)**: Required for multi-arch Docker images, not available in standard GitHub runners
- **GPU Support**: Future requirement for VSA acceleration research

The project previously attempted to use ARM64 GitHub-hosted runners, but these do not exist in the standard offering. QEMU emulation on x86_64 runners proved too slow (5-10x overhead) and unreliable for CI/CD purposes.

### Solution Approach

Implement self-hosted runner infrastructure with:

1. **Automated Runner Management**: Python-based lifecycle automation (`runner_manager.py`)
2. **Multi-Runner Support**: Deploy multiple runners for parallel builds
3. **Cost Optimization**: Auto-deregistration after idle timeout
4. **Cross-Architecture Support**: Native execution on target architectures
5. **GPU Capability**: Infrastructure ready for GPU-accelerated workloads

---

## Current State
